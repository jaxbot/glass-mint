# Glass Mint
Mint.com integration for Google Glass

Mint.com, if you haven't heard, is a web app that can pull data from most financial institutions, including my local small bank.

This is an application I put together for myself that pulls my main account balance from the Mint.com APIs, and presents me an updating card on my Glass to keep tabs on my current bank balance. It's useful to keep this number on the top of your head. Ha, puns.

Anyhow, this application is not really deployable, given the sensitive nature of the data, and the fact Mint.com does not publicly expose their APIs. But if there's interest, hit me up on Twitter, G+, or email, and I'll post instructions here on how to get an instance set up.

Open source, MIT licensed, no warranty whatsoever. Feel free to hack it around, submit PRs/feature requests, etc.

## Shameless plug
